# Day_Planner

A simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

When the user enters an event of task, they can save it with the save button; this saves it to local storage so it will remain in the app when the page is reloaded.
