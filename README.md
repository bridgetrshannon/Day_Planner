# Day_Planner

A simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

When the user enters an event or task, they can save it with the save button; this saves it to local storage so it will remain in the app when the page is reloaded. 

The user can use the inspect tool and clear local storage to remove any entries that are in local storage, ultimately clearing the day planner.

Screenshots are included of the planner filled out with and without the local storage view.
